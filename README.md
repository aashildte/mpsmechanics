# Motivation

Project for image processing -> value in itself, input other models

# Fibre orientation

Calculate vector field representing movement / direction script as

    python3 fibre_direction.py [input file] [M] [N] [X] [Y]

where input file is a csv file, M x N the desired size of the function space, X x Y the dimensions of the image corresponding to the input file, e.g. as
    
    python3 fibre_direction.py H12.csv 255 144 40 340 

# Analysis

Perform an analysis by running the script as

    python3 analysis.py [list of csv files]

eg as

    python3 analysis.py L2.csv

or, to read in all csv files in a given folder,

    python3 analysis.py [path]/*        (for linux and mac)
    python3 analysis.py [path]\*        (for windows - maybe?)

where the list of csv files contains T x X x Y lines with 2 values on each line (with the first line giving the dimensions) â€“ these are assumed to be displacement data.

The output will be saved as plots (in a folder called Plots) for visual checks as well as key values in an output file called values.csv
