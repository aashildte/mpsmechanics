Given data on displacement, this script calculates derived quantities,
including
- velocity
- strain
- beat rate

Run script as (with python 3)

    python analyze_mechanics [input files]

or install it using the setup file, running it as

    analyze_mechanics [input files]

where the input files are nd2/npy files containing displacement data.
